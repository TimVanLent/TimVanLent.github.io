buisinessmodel: non-profit. freeware.

technical specifications:
Its all code. if it eventually works properly. There will be a website on which you can enter a URL of your page after which a css will pop out. 

milestones:
1: make it work on blogapp âˆš
2: make it work on personalwebsite ..
3: turn it into an site ..
